# WardrobeWizard
This project is still in development by mattyCharitan and hadasar1.
:
Our Fashion and Wardrobe Management Application is designed to simplify your wardrobe management and help you make the most out of your clothing items.
By allowing users to scan their closet, the application gains a better understanding of their personal style and the clothing items they already own.
It provides outfit suggestions and recommendations for clothing items that complement their existing wardrobe with AI and ML technologies. 
Additionally, it can assist in making informed clothing purchases that align with the user's style.
The web API and DB(SQL) capabilities including Authentication were implemented using C#.
To recognize the clothing and users styles with ML we used Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch so we had to learn a lot on our own.
The client side isn't implented yet but it will be implented with React.
This project required a lot of self learning and diving in to a lot of interesting and challenging topics.
